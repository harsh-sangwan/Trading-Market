Trading-Market

- Client-server based Trading Market System developed in C and done through socket programming.
- Enables clients to login, buy and sell products, view their trades and see the market position (Best buying and selling of Products).
- Real-Time Trading
- Handled concurrency of trades/orders

The codes still need some improvements as of I know : 
1. Check whether same client logged in or not.

More improvements are always welcomed. :)
